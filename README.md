# Handwriting Detection System

This project is a Handwriting Detection System that utilizes machine learning to recognize and convert handwritten text from an image into digital text. It's built with Python and uses a custom-trained model to achieve this.

## üöÄ Features

* **Image to Text:** Converts handwritten text from an image file into editable digital text.
* **Simple UI:** An easy-to-use graphical interface built with Tkinter.
* **Model Based:** Uses a pre-trained machine learning model for character recognition.
* **Cross-Platform:** Built with Python, it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
* **Tkinter:** Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
* **Pillow (PIL):** For image processing tasks.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and handling image data.
* **Scikit-learn & TensorFlow/Keras:** (Or other relevant ML libraries used for model training - *please specify if different*) for building and training the recognition model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ketan1620/Handwriting-detection-System.git](https://github.com/ketan1620/Handwriting-detection-System.git)
    cd Handwriting-detection-System
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project's terminal if you don't have one already.)*

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  Launch the application.
2.  Click the "Browse" button to select an image file containing handwritten text.
3.  The application will process the image and display the recognized text in the text box.
